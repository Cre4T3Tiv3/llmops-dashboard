test_reset_prometheus.py

Unit test placeholder for the reset_prometheus_data.sh script.

Purpose:
- Ensures the test suite includes a stub for future validation of the
  Prometheus data reset script, typically used in E2E test prep.

Note:
- This is a stub test and should be replaced with actual shell validation
  logic when script behavior is finalized.
