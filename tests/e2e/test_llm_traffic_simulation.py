test_llm_traffic_simulation.py

End-to-end test scaffold for simulating LLM traffic.

This module contains a placeholder for future tests that simulate real or randomized
traffic patterns to the `/llm` endpoint. Intended to be expanded with scenarios such as:
- Burst load testing
- Mixed prompt types
- Multi-user simulation

    Placeholder E2E test for simulating LLM traffic.

    This test currently performs a no-op assertion and serves as a scaffold for
    future simulation logic involving request load, model switching, and user variability.

        - Load generation
        - Response tracking
